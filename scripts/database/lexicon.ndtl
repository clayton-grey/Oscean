PHILOSOPHY
  UNDE : About
  BREF : The design and development {{Philosophy}} behind {{Oscean}}.
  LOOK : Noir
  LONG
    & The very fabric of a tool should be imbued with intent and purpose.
    & It should be modular, combinable, stackable — Iterable as one change, and adaptable as technology evolves while remaining maintainable by others.
    @ The right amount of technology is the minimum needed to solve the problem. | Calm Technology
    & To persist across technological {*Long Term*}, not one part should be built, compiled, or minified — Every method {*specific*}, {*obvious*}, {*unobfuscated*}; each one carefully chosen against general-purpose libraries, frameworks or wasteful foreign entities.
    & It should aspire to always be {*frictionless and undisruptive*}. Its formats and subsequent products versionable, re-purposable, interpretable and text-editable; graphics vectors, audio mods and databases flat-files.
    & Only through open sources, open standards, human-readable formats and their independencies, might they survive this fleeting age of self-destructing informatics.
    & These attributes should not only be perceptible in its design, <br />but deeply rooted in its code.

    & {{Renaud Bedard|http://theinstructionlimit.com/}} and I showcased an experimental game at {*Prince of the Arcade*} last year but, between {{Volkenessen}}, {{Diluvium}} and {{Waiting for Horus}}, only got back to release it now. 
    & It is called {{Pico Battle}} and like our other {{Pico}} titled game — this game also plays with colours; but this time, in multiplayer.
    % youtube et58Ndob9M4
    & Unlike our last game, text-heavy {{Diluvium}}, {*Pico Battle*} is wordless. There is no contextual hints within the game, but an audio tutorial that starts automaticaly in the lobby.
    * Lobby
    & Upon launching the game, you will find yourself in the Lobby, a temporary haven. You should look for an hexagon floating about the edges of your screen (right click drag to rotate around the planet) and click on it to practice against the AI. You might see circles too, they are other players and could challenge you as soon as you raise your shield.
    * Shielding
    & To protect yourself against incoming attacks, find the patch of dirt marked by a black and white circle, and connect a node to it. The shield will light up, eating away at the incoming bullets with a similar hue. In the lobby, you are invisible to potential attackers as long as your shield is unpowered.
    * Shooting
    & To win against your opponent, locate a patch of mushrooms and connect nodes to it — this is your cannon. It needs a minimum amount of power to be able to fire, and based on the incoming nodes, will fire bullets of various sizes and colours; easier or harder to defend against. The idea being to match the colour of incoming bullets with your shield, and to differ as much as possible from the opponent’s shield colour (which is indicated by the contour of his circular icon) with your cannon’s bullets.

  LONG
<<<<<<< HEAD
    & The very fabric of a tool should be imbued with intent and purpose.
    & It should be modular, combinable, stackable — Iterable as one change, and adaptable as technology evolves while remaining maintainable by others.
    @ The right amount of technology is the minimum needed to solve the problem. | Calm Technology
    & To persist across technological {*Long Term*}, not one part should be built, compiled, or minified — Every method {*specific*}, {*obvious*}, {*unobfuscated*}; each one carefully chosen against general-purpose libraries, frameworks or wasteful foreign entities.
    & It should aspire to always be {*frictionless and undisruptive*}. Its formats and subsequent products versionable, re-purposable, interpretable and text-editable; graphics vectors, audio mods and databases flat-files.
    & Only through open sources, open standards, human-readable formats and their independencies, might they survive this fleeting age of self-destructing informatics.
    & These attributes should not only be perceptible in its design, <br />but deeply rooted in its code.
=======
    & Most of our {*New Zealand*} pictures were taken on {{Film}}.
    & We sailed to New Zealand aboard {{Pino}} in 2016, from {{Tonga|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonga}}, on our way to {{Japan}}, during our {{South Pacific}} circumnavigation. We were moored in Whangarei for 8 months.

AESTHETICS

  BREF : {{Aesthetics}} are notes on output, advised from {{daily logs|Horaire}}.
  TAGS : Index
  LONG
    & This is less a personal guideline than the {*results of side-effects*}.
    & It is {*not*} about achieving happiness, as I could not find correlations between happiness and productivity; productivity occurred equally during low happiness and high happiness.
    & I have based my life toward {{two aspirations|Goals}}, {_Arts & Sciences_}. I have thus devised th my life to be aimed their sole acceleration. Analysis of {{personal statistics|Horaire}} revealed {{travel}} to be an important enabler for inspiration, and so I have steered my work toward facilitating opportunities to travel. A step away from {_Arts & Sciences_} was then, a step backward.
    @ Optimizing toward the {*need for less revenue*} has yielded better results than optimizing toward the generation of more revenue.
    & School was forcing me into multi-tasking, which revealed itself to have a negative impact to the creation of {_Arts & Sciences_}. Working within the confines of a single medium, would invoke long periods of lesser creativity and intermittent productivity. Living at any one place over a period exceeding multiple years showed a decay in inspiration. Leaving school, learning to play music, moving abroad - showed an improvement in the realization of {_Arts & Sciences_}.
    & Automating work always returned higher reward than any attempt at brute force. Over a period of 6 months, building specific {{tools}} mostly returned higher performance than {{learning general purpose tools|Philosophy}}.
    & Remaining immobile in moments of doubts and planning, always gave a positive outcome, against acting impulsively making possible accidental steps away from the acceleration of {_Arts & Sciences_}.
    & I have kept {{daily logs|Calendar}} on personal {_productivity output_}, and used this data to steer productivity across flux in focus. Each day has a singular task assigned, connected to a specific medium. The output portion of the day(programming, designing, composing), ends with the completion of the one task, whereas the remaining time is spent on input(reading, watching, listening).
    @ The purpose of this discipline <br />is to {*limit multi-tasking*}.
    & When a day ends before its assigned task was complete, the day was a planning failure; the task is then divided into smaller tasks, each assigned to one day. When the day ends too early after the completion of the one task, the day was also a planning failure.
    & I do not get out of bed until I have chosen a {_task to complete_} & and a {_lesson to learn_}, and I do not go to sleep until I have logged the results.
    & I select my tasks in the following order, I first address the problems that slow me down, the questions that occupy the idle mind, and the things I find lacking in life.

    & I find myself doing design, when a developer, and programming when I should be designing. Atop the creative rhythms, the daily logs reveal a form of {{stamina|Tracker}} that I use to allocate blocks of time to any one task, knowing when the stamina runs out and by when the task must be completed.
    & Years passed, and each morning, I am told what I should do, that which is likely to yield the {*most concrete output per work hour*}, based on previous patterns of productivity. 
    & It is not optimizing toward longer work hours, but to helping me navigate these peaks & valleys by assigning me a task likely to convert to the optimal amount of concrete work, per focus hour.
    & I sometimes wonder wether it has helped me reach optimal productivity, or has kept me from getting there.

NOMAD
  UNDE : Lifestyle
  BREF : The {{Nomad}} notes are reflexions on the dreams of a nomadic life.
  LONG
    & My first encounter with a nomad was during my stay in Prague, as Santiago, I had just met my {*Fulcanelli*}. 
    & There was a time in life when I may have felt homesick. But from then on, {_home_} was anywhere but here, a vague concept that existed out there, {_forever fleeting_}.
    & The office is no place for multi-disciplinarists, and {{Japan}} was where I last fought this loosing battle. My desk, not the medium onto which I would acquire the array of skills I longed for.
    & Living on a {{sailboat|Pino}} was not picked amongst other equally enticing ideas. It was, at the time, the only {{pragmatic solution|https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sF9TNM9R-iw}}. It would at once, align with everything that I believed in and wanted in life. In that, it might not correspond to your meaning of {_travel_}, or even be replicable.
    & The monthly rent of our beachside Tokyo housing was nearly 1.5K$USD, and this thus implicated some serious downsizing. Within 3 years, our 20K$USD sailboat would be paid at the rate of 600$ per month.
    @ Will you trade the proximity to friends and family in exchange for your independence?
    & To think that, at the time, the most heart-breaking things to let go were instruments, old consoles, books and some camera equipment — when the truly hard things to let go would be my habitual bath, tap water and reliable internet connection.
    & Everything costs more than expected, takes longer than expected and Amazon doesn't deliver to your {{desert island|South Pacific}}. Surely you did not do all this travel for the travel alone, you had passions, habits and goals when you left.
    @ You've made it, you live a nomadic life. <br />Well done. Now what?
    & The wind rocks the habitat sideways, keeping you up at night. In the morning, you get to spend your day writing, anchored in the most beautiful bay, you go for a swim.
    & You forget about tap water, don't mind the warm water from the plastic jugs, you wonder why people take showers every day and time away from Twitter really does make you feel better.
    & Suddenly, it's business as usual. You get back to building things, only now, when you look outside, the upmost gorgeous sunset precedes the darkest of night.
    & Over a year, we managed to sail 3000nm from Victoria to La Paz, while creating games, music and art.
    & We learnt how to fix sails, repair a toilet, create electronic systems, maintain an engine, live without a fridge and power.
    & We have seen every sunset and almost every sunrise, we have sailed with dolphins, we have climbed mountains on desert islands, and we have met the most amazing people.
    @ Being nomad is trading the things<br />you think you care about, <br />for things you didn't know existed.

NUTRITION
  UNDE : Lifestyle
  BREF : The {{Nutrition}} guide covers the basics of proteins.
  LONG
    & There are a few things in life that are as transformative and transhumanistic as {{nutrition}}.
    & Eating a plant/fungi/algae-based diet aligns with my pragmatic views of {*life-prolonging aspirations*}.
    & The function of proteins is to be used for tissue growth and repair, but when carbohydrates and calories are lacking, proteins can be consumed for fuel.
    & The human body's own proteins are constantly being broken down into {*amino acids*} and used throughout its systems.
    & The human body is mostly made of proteins, and proteins are made of amino acids - permutations of carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and sometimes sulphur. There are 22 amino acids in total and all but 9 can be synthesized, the {*Essential Amino Acids*}.
    & To be used for growth and repair, a protein needs to be a {*complete protein*}, or have access the full sequence of required essential amino acids. If an essential amino acid is missing, the unusable remaining amino acids are broken down into fats or sugars.
    & Examples of foods with essential amino acid content of at least 70% of a complete protein(see {_Limiting Amino Acids_}) are oats, garbanzo beans, sunflower seeds, buckwheat, red/white/black beans, rice, peanuts and pumpkin seeds.
    & There are also high-quality proteins in green beans, swiss chard, broccoli, mustard greens, asparagus and potatoes but in lesser quantity.
    & Soy products have within them 100% of a complete protein, or the correct ratio of essential amino acids for the body to use in tissue growth and repair.
    & The high-quality protein foods can be made whole by combining with other ingredients, but the basic optimal combinations is {*Beans with grains, nuts or seeds*}.
