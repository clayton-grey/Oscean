For example, a vote in a democracy, the more people that believe their vote counts towards the outcome of an election, the less their votes count.  Also known as the Reverse Tinkerbell effect.
  Anti-epistemology : Bad explicit beliefs about rules of reasoning, usually developed in the course of protecting an existing false belief
HEURISTICS
  Absurdity : Mental shortcut where highly untypical situations are classified as absurd or impossible.
  Affect : Mental shortcut basing a decision on an emotional reaction rather than a calculation.
  Availability : Mental shortcut that treats easily recalled information as important or more important than alternative solutions which are not as readily recalled.
  Representativeness : Mental shortcut where people judge the probability or frequency of a hypothesis by considering how much the hypothesis resembles available data as opposed to using a Bayesian calculation.
  Rationalization : Starts from a conclusion, and then works backward to arrive at arguments apparently favouring that conclusion. Rationalization argues for a side already selected.
BELIEFS
  Belief : The mental state in which an individual holds a proposition to be true.
  Priors : The beliefs an agent holds regarding a fact, hypothesis or consequence, before being presented with evidence.
  Alief : An independent source of emotional reaction which can coexist with a contradictory belief. {_Example_} The fear felt when a monster jumps out of the darkness in a scary movie is based on the alief that the monster is about to attack you, even though you believe that it cannot.
  Proper belief : Requires observations, gets updated upon encountering new evidence, and provides practical benefit in anticipated experience.
  Improper belief : Is a belief that isn't concerned with describing the territory. Note that the fact that a belief just happens to be true doesn't mean you're right to have it. If you buy a lottery ticket, certain that it's a winning ticket (for no reason), and it happens to be, believing that was still a mistake.
  Belief in belief : Where it is difficult to believe a thing, it is often much easier to believe that you ought to believe it. Were you to really believe and not just believe in belief, the consequences of error would be much more severe. When someone makes up excuses in advance, it would seem to require that belief, and belief in belief, have become unsynchronized.
  A Priori : Knowledge which we can be sure of without any empirical evidence(evidence from our senses). So, knowledge that you could realize if you were just a mind floating in a void {unconnected to a body(Philipp Traum)}.

  Ex silentio : Argument relying on ignorance.
  Non sequitur : An inference that does not follow from established premises or evidence; "It does not follow". {_Example_} There occured an increase of births during the full moon. Conclusion, full moons cause birth rates to rise. But does a full moon actually cause more births, or did it occur for other reasons, perhaps from expected statistical variations?
  Ex nihilo : Or {_Out Of Nothing_} An argument that bears no relation to the previous topic of discussion.
ARGUMENTATION
  By analogy : Arguing that since things are alike in some ways, they will probably be alike in others.
  By definition : Arguing that something is part of a class because it fits the definition of that class.

  Straw man : Creating a false or made up scenario and then attacking it. Painting your opponent with false colors only deflects the purpose of the argument. {_Example_}: Evolutionists think that everything came about by random chance.
  Steel man : Opposite of strawman. To steelman is to address the strongest possible variant or the most charitable interpretation of an idea, rather than the most available phrasings. Steelmanning can be especially important when the network by which phrasings are brought to your attention has a preference for propagating uncharitable/controversial phrasings.
  Rapoport’s First Rule : You should attempt to re-express your target’s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, “Thanks, I wish I’d thought of putting it that way.”
  Red herring : A diversion from the active topic.
  Fully general counterargument : An argument which can be used to discount any conclusion the arguer does not like. Being in possession of such an argument leads to irrationality because it allows the arguer to avoid updating their beliefs. {_Example_} You're just saying that because you're exhibiting X bias.
  Aumann's Agreement Theorem : Two people acting rationally(in a certain precise sense) and with common knowledge of each other's beliefs cannot agree to disagree.

  Operationalizing : Where both parties understand they’re in a cooperative effort to fix exactly what they’re arguing about.
  Survey of evidence : Not trying to devastate the other person with a mountain of facts and start looking at the studies and arguments on both sides and figuring out what kind of complex picture they paint.
  Disputing definitions : Argument hinges on the meaning of words, or whether something counts as a member of a category or not.
  Single Studies : Better than scattered facts, proving they at least looked into the issue formally.
  Demands for rigor : Attempts to demand that an opposing argument be held to such strict standards that nothing could possibly clear the bar.
  Single Facts : One fact, which admittedly does support their argument, but presented as if it solves the debate in and of itself. 
  Gotchas : Short claims that purport to be devastating proof that one side can’t possibly be right.
  Social shaming : A demand for listeners to place someone outside the boundary of whom deserve to be heard.

  Jakob’s Law : Users spend most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they already know.
  Miller’s Law : The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.
  Pareto Principle : The Pareto principle states that, for many events, roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes.
  Parkinson’s Law : Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.
  Serial Position Effect : Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.
  Tesler’s Law : Tesler's Law, also known as The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.
  Zeigarnik Effect : People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.
  Law of Prägnanz : People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpretation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.
  Law of Proximity [Prägnanz] : Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.
  Law of Closure [Prägnanz] : The law of closure states that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, as being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap.
  Law of Symmetry [Prägnanz] : The law of symmetry states that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point.
  Von Restorff Effect [Prägnanz] : The Von Restorff effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.
DARK PATTERNS
  Bait and Switch : You set out to do one thing, but a different, undesirable thing happens instead.
  Confirmshaming : Confirmshaming is the act of guilting the user into opting into something. The option to decline is worded in such a way as to shame the user into compliance.
  Disguised Ads : Adverts that are disguised as other kinds of content or navigation, in order to get you to click on them.
  Forced Continuity : When your free trial with a service comes to an end and your credit card silently starts getting charged without any warning. In some cases this is made even worse by making it difficult to cancel the membership.
  Friend Spam : The product asks for your email or social media permissions under the pretence it will be used for a desirable outcome (e.g. finding friends), but then spams all your contacts in a message that claims to be from you.
  Hidden Costs : You get to the last step of the checkout process, only to discover some unexpected charges have appeared, e.g. delivery charges, tax, etc.
  Misdirection : The design purposefully focuses your attention on one thing in order to distract you attention from another.
  Price Comparison Prevention : The retailer makes it hard for you to compare the price of an item with another item, so you cannot make an informed decision.
  Privacy Zuckering : You are tricked into publicly sharing more information about yourself than you really intended to. 
  Roach Motel : The design makes it very easy for you to get into a certain situation, but then makes it hard for you to get out of it (e.g. a subscription).
  Sneak into Basket : You attempt to purchase something, but somewhere in the purchasing journey the site sneaks an additional item into your basket, often through the use of an opt-out radio button or checkbox on a prior page.
  Trick Questions : You respond to a question, which, when glanced upon quickly appears to ask one thing, but if read carefully, asks another thing entirely.
UNIX
  Modularity : Write simple parts connected by clean interfaces.
  Clarity : Clarity is better than cleverness.
  Composition : Design programs to be connected to other programs.
  Separation : Separate policy from mechanism; separate interfaces from engines.
  Simplicity : Design for simplicity; add complexity only where you must.
  Parsimony : Write a big program only when it is clear by demonstration that nothing else will do.
  Transparency : Design for visibility to make inspection and debugging easier.
  Robustness : Robustness is the child of transparency and simplicity.
  Representation : Fold knowledge into data so program logic can be stupid and robust.
  Least  Surprise : In interface design, always do the least surprising thing.
  Silence : When a program has nothing surprising to say, it should say nothing.
  Repair : When you must fail, fail noisily and as soon as possible.
  Economy : Programmer time is expensive; conserve it in preference to machine time.
  Generation : Avoid hand-hacking; write programs to write programs when you can.
  Optimization : Prototype before polishing. Get it working before you optimize it.
  Diversity : Distrust all claims for “one true way”.
  Extensibility : Design for the future, because it will be here sooner than you think.
DEVELOPMENT
  NIH Syndrome : Or {_Not Invented Here_}, to avoid using already existing products, research, standards, or knowledge because of their external origins or costs.
  Anti-Pattern : A common response to a recurring problem that is usually ineffective and risks being highly counterproductive.
  Worse Is Better : The idea that quality does not necessarily increase with functionality. Software that is limited, but simple to use, may be more appealing to the user and market than the reverse.
  Dogfood : A way for an organization to demonstrate confidence in its own products, by using the product itself. A way to test it in real-world usage, acting as quality control and a kind of testimonial advertising.
  Stovepipe : A system that has the potential to share data or functionality with other systems but which does not.
  The Cathedral model : The source code is available with each software release, but code developed between releases is restricted to an exclusive group of developers.
  The Bazaar model : The code is developed over the Internet in view of the public.
  XY Problem : You want to do X, and you think Y is the best way of doing so. Instead of asking about X, you ask about Y.
